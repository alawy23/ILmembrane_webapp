# **Ionic Liquids Membrane Permeability vs. Selectivity Plot**

***

### **Axes:**
**x-axis:** Permeability of $CO_{2}$ in Barrers.

**y-axis:** Selectivity of $\frac{CO_{2}}{N_{2}}$ or $\frac{CO_{2}}{CH_{4}}$.

### **Widgets:**
##### **There are three types of highlighter or filter widgets**
- **Buttons:**
  - The reset button returns the plot to its initial state.
- **Switches:**
  - The type switch displays the markers with different colors according to the membrane type.
    - Once the switch is turned on, a legend will show. Click on a certain type on the legend to filter it, or double click to show only the chosen membrane type.
- **Sliders:**
  - Permeability and Selectivity sliders can be used to show datapoints within the chosen permeability or selectivity range.
  - Year slider can be used to show datapoints within the chosen date range.
- **Pickers:**
  - Journal and Author pickers can be used to show datapoints published in the chosen journal/s or by the chosen author/s.
    - User can use the search function to search for a certain journal or authors.
  - Cation and Anion pickers can be used to show datapoints of membranes made with the chosen cations or anions.
    - User can use the search function to search for a certain cation or anion.

### **Tips:**
- Click on a datapoint to show a pop up window contining extra information about the membrane.
- Check the tool tab above the plot for useful tools.
  - As default, the *zoom* tool is selected. Drag and select with you mouse to zoom into the selected datapoints.
- You can use the tools and widgets simultaneously.
